I was leading the project and\nMy teamates also didn't know the machine learning or python for that matter. So I delagated the web dev and exploration tasks to them and my self went into the rabbit hole of how we should apporach the main problem. I used chat gpt, perplexity and a friend to get an idea on the basic approach. \nIt was maddness. I didn't sleep much those( I probbably should have) and that costed me dearly. When there was the presentation day I was not able to give it fully and explain what we have done beacuse I had gotten sick, and we were duly unprepared for the presentation. we didn't win ofc but it was a good first experience on leadership and management and i was beaten up quite thoroughly hehe.",

(I still am tbh) I apply for an internship, they give me an assignment which i complete and give them the github link. And they just completely ghost me and I cna't do nothing about it. It is so frustarating like it is fine if am getting out from the interview round but they didn't let me get there and their medium to hard level assignments man. They don't even provide any feedback for that."
